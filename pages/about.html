              Nowadays, <b>climate change is one of the hottest topics</b> of our time and it is discussed worldwide,
              from
              online
              forums to local news outlets. We are witnessing its impact on our skin
              and the word sustainability is now on everyone's lips.
              <br><br>
              As our concern and its popularity rise,<b>companies have been trying to align their businesses to the new
                green
                values</b> but more and more people are also talking about greenwashing.
              But what does it mean?
              <br><br><b>Greenwashing</b> can be defined as <i>“unsubstantiated claims or activities which deceive
                consumers into
                believing that a company has a greater positive environmental impact than
                is true”</i> <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions"
                target="_blank"><u> [Source]</u></a>
              <br><br><i>“Sometimes businesses are accused of greenwashing because what they say and what they do
                apparently
                don’t match perfectly”</i>. As stated in the IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and
              Land <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/srccl/" target="_blank"><u> [Source]</u></a>, 34% of all man-made CO2
              emissions are generated by the food industry and among these,
              fast
              food chains
              play a crucial role in the environmental discourse. As a result, they are constantly under the media radar
              and
              that’s why they are the main focus of this research.”

              This archive allows you to <b>explore</b> different kinds of green storytelling
              made by fast food companies nowadays and the common patterns behind them.
              <br><br>
              By choosing each recipe, you can consult actual examples of sentences extracted from
              their websites. <b>Recipes are a metaphor</b> to represent the most recurring <b>strategies
                of green communication</b> through ingredients that are combined together.
              <br><br>

            <h3>Keywords: setting up the dataset</h3>
            <p class="slideP">
              This archive is based on research studying the <b>websites of the 9 most popular fast food
                chains in the US</b> -as a matter of fact, these companies originated in the United States,
              the world's second-largest carbon emitter, with its <b>5 billion tonnes of CO2</b> (2021)<sup>1</sup>.
              They were selected by using the following criteria: annual revenue, total number of
              stores open world wide, and has at list one sustainability-related section on their websites.
              The companies that fulfilled the criteria are: McDonald’s, KFC, Burger King, Wendy’s, Domino’s, Subway,
              Krispy Kreme, Starbucks, Pizza Hut

            <p class="slideP">To analyse the language, it was necessary to create a <b>custom-made green glossary</b>.
              To do so, firstly it was needed to get a deeper comprehension of the concept of sustainability.
              The definition of sustainability from Britannica<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/sustainability" target="_blank"><u> [Source]</u></a> provided a solid theoretical basis.
              Moreover, the prototype of the glossary comes from the article <i class="slideP">“Clever’s Green Glossary:
                46 Sustainable Key Words to Help You Shop Smarter”</i> of the website Clever*. In order to collect
              keywords more effectively, we only selected the ones related to the food industry. Ultimately,
              it features 41 keywords<a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/go-green-glossary" target="_blank"><u> [Source]</u></a> related to environmental issues, strongly connected to the fast food
              market and used in today's green narratives.
              <br><br>
              The research was further deepened by selecting only <b>23 keywords</b> out of initial 41. The ones that
              were
              chosen
              are directly related to environmental issues and/or are the most recurring ones.

            <img class="flex-column imgSq" src="./assets/imgs/glossary.svg" alt="glossary">
            <p class="slideP">
              In order to understand why and how these keywords are used in their context, the dataset was enriched by
              <b>collecting
                all the sentences</b> in which they appear. Furthermore, those keywords were searched on each “.com” of
              the
              company's
              website to avoid results on a geographical basis and to reach a neutral view of the topic (i.e. <a
                href="https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us.html" target="_blank"><u>www.mcdonalds.com</u></a> instead <a
                href="https://www.mcdonalds.it/" target="_blank"><u>www.mcdonalds.it</u></a>).

            <h3>Tags: understanding the context</h3>
            <p class="slideP">
              Sentences were collected, read and evaluated manually. In order to analyze the context in which the
              sentence
              is placed,
              <b>labels were assigned</b> to each of them to describe them fully and in depth.

              The label <b>Topic</b> was made according to discussed matters in the sentences to create a frame

              sustainability

                <p class="slideP">This table was made possible by applying a formula to the previous 'Dataset'
                  spreadsheet
                  that automatically identifies the TRUE results (selected boxes) for each topic pair. For example, in
                  the
                  case of Food-Animals, the formula only takes into account results that are simultaneously TRUE within
                  the
                  columns of the topics FOOD and ANIMALS.</p>

                <p class="slideP">Within each topic pair, the most repeated keywords were counted and extracted. Thus,
                  after
                  counting them, the keyword that was the most repeated in that specific topic pair was selected as an
                  ingredient.</p>

                <p class="slideP">In this step, now it was possible to summarise each finding by counting and filtering
                  the
                  sentences according to the label Aim and the label Evidence. In other words, it was possible to see
                  how
                  many sentences contained Take action or Dissemination, and how many of them were labeled as Statistic
                  or
                  Groundless.</p>

                <p class="slideP">The results in the table were obtained through a formula: for each row of the table
                  (therefore each recipe) we asked on the "Dataset" spreadsheet to count each URL, with at least one of
                  the
                  two recipe topics assigned, that the "Aim" column marked as "take action". An analogue process was
                  subsequently carried out to count how many URLs marked as Aim "Dissemination". Same logic to then
                  count
                  the results with "statistics/groundless" evidence.From these results was then possible to get the
                  percentages that are shown in the recipes’ introduction. </p>
