            Nowadays, <b>climate change is one of the hottest topics</b> of our
            time and it is discussed worldwide, from online forums to local news
            outlets! We are witnessing its impact on our skin and the word
            sustainability is now on everyone's lips. <br /><br />
            As our concern and its popularity rise, companies have been trying
            to align their businesses to the <b>new green values</b> but more
            and more people are also talking about greenwashing. But what does
            it mean? <br /><br /><b>Greenwashing</b> can be defined as
            “unsubstantiated claims or activities which deceive consumers into
            believing that a company has a greater positive environmental impact
            than is true”. source Sometimes businesses are accused of
            greenwashing because what they say and what they do apparently don’t
            match perfectly. Among them are fast food chains that are constantly
            under the media radar.” <br /><br />The IPCC Special Report on
            Climate Change and Land states that <b>34% of all man-made CO2</b>
            emissions are generated by the food industry. Among these, fast food
            companies play a crucial role in the environmental discourse.
            <br /><br />As a matter of fact, these companies originated in the
            United States, the world's second-largest carbon emitter, with its 5
            billion tonnes of CO2 (2021). source

            The research focuses on the <b>nine most popular fast food chains
            websites</b> in the US that were selected by the following criteria:
            annual revenue, total number of stores open world wide, and has at
            list one sustainability-related section on their websites.
            <br /><br />The companies that fulfilled the criteria are: <br />

          <p class="slideP">
            The research study objects are the .com domains of fast food
            companies. In this way, it was possible to avoid results on a
            geographical basis and to reach a <b>neutral</b> view of the topic.

            <br /><br />To analyse the language, it was necessary to create a
            custom-made green glossary . It features 41 keywords related to
            different environmental issues and topics, which are strongly
            connected to the fast food market and are frequently used in today's
            <b>green narratives</b>. source

            <br /><br /> After selecting the most fitting keywords, they were 
            searched on each company’s website and the results were then computed to find out <b>the most used ones</b>.
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <div class="flex-row roundTag"><p>screening</p></div>
          <p class="slideP">
            Furthermore, through thorough screening, some keywords were discarded to cleanse the dataset, in order to 
            avoid repetitions and insignificant results. This decision was taken consciously, with the main goal of 
            <b>not damaging the balance</b> of the statistical sample and analysing the topic in a more relevant and in-depth way.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="slide">
          <p class="slideP">
            In order to understand why and how these keywords are used on the chosen fast food companies websites, the dataset was 
            enriched by collecting all the sentences in which they appear. 
            It was then possible to better understand the context of each green term through a heeded categorisation, based on specific discriminants: keywords, topic, aim, evidences.

          <p class="slideP">
            The aim of the archive is to allow users to explore different kinds of green storytelling made by fast food companies nowdays and the 
            common patterns behind them. The users can choose among recipes composed of ingredients which represent the most used discriminants in every sentence.
